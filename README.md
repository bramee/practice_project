repository for practice projects from DTI.

Here I have explained about the classification problem with encoding technique and applied different algorithms and cross validation score to improve the accuracy score.

Used algorithm :
  1) Logistic Regression
  2) Random Forest Classifier
  3) Decision Tree Classifier
  4) Support vector Classifier
  
 Label Encoder
 
 Cross validation Score to check whether the model is over fitting or not
 
 Used Hyper parameter tuning to improve the accuracy.
